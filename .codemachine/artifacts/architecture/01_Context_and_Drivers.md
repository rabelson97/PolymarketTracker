## 1. Introduction & Goals

<!-- anchor: project-vision -->
### 1.1. Project Vision
Automate the discovery of newly active Polymarket wallets that immediately deploy significant capital, enabling analysts, traders, and researchers to track high-value entrants and understand emerging market dynamics.

<!-- anchor: key-objectives -->
### 1.2. Key Objectives
- Deliver batch analytics identifying wallets whose first bet margin is at least $5,000.
- Ensure wallet balance validation for thresholds of $50,000 or more using authoritative on-chain data.
- Provide exportable outputs (JSON, CSV, console) for downstream analysis.
- Maintain modular design supporting future real-time upgrades and notification integrations.
- Achieve maintainable Python codebase with testable business logic and manageable dependencies.

<!-- anchor: scope -->
### 1.3. Scope
- **In Scope:** Batch ingestion of recent Polymarket trades, wallet enrichment via API/on-chain queries, margin evaluation, caching to reduce redundant calls, and report generation.
- **Out of Scope:** Real-time streaming pipelines, long-term historical analytics, behavior prediction, automated alerting, or production-grade dashboards.

<!-- anchor: key-assumptions -->
### 1.4. Key Assumptions
- Polymarket exposes accessible REST or GraphQL endpoints for recent trades and markets.
- Wallet balances can be obtained via Polygon network RPC (USDC) within rate limits.
- Batch processing targets a recent lookback period (default 7 days) configurable via environment variables.
- Execution runs within a controlled environment (CLI/job runner) with network access and secure secret storage.

## 2. Architectural Drivers

<!-- anchor: functional-summary -->
### 2.1. Functional Requirements Summary
- Ingest recent trades/bets from Polymarket.
- Determine whether each wallet is a fresh entrant and compute first-bet margin.
- Enrich qualifying wallets with current balance and persist/cache processed data.
- Export qualifying wallet details in machine-consumable formats for analysts.

<!-- anchor: non-functional-requirements -->
### 2.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- **Performance:** Process 24 hours of trade data within 5 minutes by batching requests and leveraging caching.
- **Scalability:** Design modular components enabling horizontal scaling or serverless invocation without tight coupling.
- **Reliability:** Include retry logic, graceful degradation, and idempotent caching to handle transient API failures.
- **Maintainability:** Adopt layered architecture, typed dataclasses, and automated tests for analysis logic.
- **Security:** Secure external keys/endpoints via environment variables, respect API rate limits, and sanitize inputs/outputs.
- **Observability:** Provide structured logging and metrics hooks for future monitoring integration.

<!-- anchor: constraints-preferences -->
### 2.3. Constraints & Preferences
- Preference for Python ecosystem (requests, web3/py-clob-client) per specification.
- Batch processing acceptable; real-time streaming explicitly not required.
- Storage layer should remain lightweight (SQLite or JSON) avoiding heavy operational overhead.
- Must comply with Polymarket terms of service and handle potential rate limiting gracefully.
