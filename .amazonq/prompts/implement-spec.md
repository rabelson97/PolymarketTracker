You are implementing a Polymarket Fresh Wallet Tracker based on the specification in `spec/SPEC.md`.

## Your Task

Read `spec/SPEC.md` and implement the solution following these guidelines:

1. **Follow the spec exactly** - implement all functional requirements
2. **Use the specified architecture** - Data Fetcher → Wallet Analyzer → Output
3. **Implement the data models** as defined
4. **Apply the algorithm** step-by-step
5. **Use the listed dependencies**
6. **Meet success criteria**

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up project structure
2. Implement Polymarket API client
3. Create wallet analyzer logic
4. Add output formatting
5. Include error handling
6. Add configuration management

## Code Quality

- Write clean, minimal code
- Add docstrings for functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Follow Python best practices
- Include a README with usage instructions

## Testing

- Validate with real Polymarket data
- Test edge cases (no qualifying wallets, API errors)
- Verify calculations are correct

Start by reading the spec, then implement the solution.
